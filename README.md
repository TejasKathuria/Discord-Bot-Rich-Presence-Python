# Discord Bot Status
We all have seen a custom status on a discord bot like 'playing a game' or 'watching a movie', that is known as 'Rich Presence'. We have to enter some lines of code to add a custom rich presence in a Discord Bot. This Repository will help you to add a custom rich presence in your discord bot. Make sure to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheOriginalTKT) for latest updates!!
